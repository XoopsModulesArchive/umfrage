SUPPORT OF CBB 3.08:

 In the directory _hack_cbb are the files for CBB 3.08 to use umfrage
with that module. Simply copy the files into the newbb directory of 
your installation. It's important that you exchange your newbb_poll_results.html
with the included file, because for the handling of the blind votes.
