1.0.5 to 1.1
===================
FEATURE:	Now the module can notify by email to a voter that his vote
					has been collected.

FEATURE:	We can also limit the number of selected options for a
					multiple choice poll. For example, in a multiple choice poll
					with ten options, we can put a limit of three, so people can
					only mark three options at most of those ten.

FEATURE:	The voting control by Cookie and IP are now optional
					and configured in the module's Preferences dialog.
					This was required for the module to work in a net with proxies.

1.0.4 to 1.0.5
===================
BUGFIX:   Module doesn't work on hosting with 
          deprecated by PHP superglobals like $HTTP_*_VARS 
          and which are disabled in php.ini : register_long_arrays = 0
Solution: change all those superglobals to appropriate 
          equivalents of $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST, etc.

ADDED:    Russian language. (UTF-8 with no BOM)


1.0.3 to 1.0.4
===================
BUGFIX:	  Vote button was shown even if no voting was possible
Solution: There was a logic flaw in class/umfragerenderer.php

BUGFIX:   White Page in CBB when showing a vote
Solution: In the hack of newbb/viewtopic.php was an error

BUGFIX:	  In CBB a vote could be made even if the poll was over
Solution: Logic flaw in the hack newbb/viewtopic.php

	
1.0.2 to 1.0.3
===================
BUGFIX: White Page when poll was over and no votes were made
ADDED:  _PL_HALFBLIND for blind votes wuth result visible

1.00 to 1.0.1
===================

BUGFIX:	Not logged in users could vote and got a blank screen
		Bug reported from svaha at xoops.org:
		When I give anonymous users rights to enter the module,
		but no right to vote, the vote button shows up in the
		results screen and when clicked gives a blank screen.
		Should this button not be hidden for anonymous users?
